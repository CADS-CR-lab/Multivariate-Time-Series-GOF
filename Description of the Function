This function returns a corrected critical value given a specific combination of number of time series, sample size, and lag
The number of time series ranges: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10
Sample Size: any number 40 to 300
Lag: 2 to (sample size-1)

The function does not give an error when the input is out of range. Instead, it will return an empty value.

Note: the univariate case is added to the function, adopted from work done by Sidy Daniko et al. (2022)
